## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{python}
import pandas as pd
xmas = pd.read_csv("https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/qxaslqqp5p08i1650rpc4/xmas.csv?rlkey=erdxi7jbh7pqf9fh4lv4cayp5&dl=1")
```
